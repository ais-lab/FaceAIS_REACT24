# Adapted from lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch

Thank @lucidrains for their implementation of the quantization method, this directory is a simple copy from their repository. Their implementation is used in the quantization process of the model. The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch/tree/master).
